      There’s a lot of crazy shit going on right now: widespread war and displacement, famine, ecological collapse, far-right movements (to mention a few). These issues extend way beyond my reach and feel overwhelming to think about. Yet, I carry a desire to leave a positive mark on our world. But where to start? The ideal scenario: every human being has their basic needs met. Man-made boundaries dissolve and shift to seamless togetherness. There’s no conflict, hatred, or discrimination. We recognise the sanctity of Mother Earth and take care of her. Our relationship with the world is defined by harmony, not exploitation. In essence, as if we all took a tab of ecstasy and loved each other unconditionally.

      Let’s stay grounded. I know that I’m interested in 
      <a href="placeholder1.html" class="spring-link">
        container technologies<sup>1</sup>
      </a> 
      (such as bridges) and how non-living structures challenge our views of social hierarchies. So in October, I started studying the 622-metre Hammersmith Flyover. The elevated structure carries the A4 road over a busy central junction in the borough of Hammersmith. It was built in 1961 by white, male individuals, pushing and pulling equipment in an 
      <a href="placeholder2.html" class="spring-link">
        erotic dance<sup>2</sup>
      </a> 
      of construction work. The flyover is composed of a continuous hollow spine beam, 26 feet wide, with arms to support the outer carriageways. A hollow interior runs the whole length of the structure, accommodating surface drainage, electricity supply, and a water main feeding fire hydrants above. Its slender and elegant lines, along with its self-regulating functions, make it impossible to read as passive or unintelligent. Instead, it emerges as a dynamic, (female) entity intricately tied to its environment, its identity inscribed by the powerful white men who built it.

      At night, I hear cars passing over the flyover. I wonder where people are going so late. I ask myself if my interest in container technologies is a compensation for my own relative deficiency in the container department. Upon waking, I salute the flyover along with the rising sun. It never rests. Its automated systems ensure a 24-hour facilitating environment to meet the demands of our metropolis: escorting 
      <a href="placeholder3.html" class="spring-link">
        hasty men<sup>3</sup>
      </a> 
      to and from the other side, each striving to surmount that which is unsound in them. Similar to mothers, who nurture and provide for their infants. I can tell the structure is worn down. Rust and other imperfections have quietly settled onto its membrane. Perhaps, being porous enables intimacy with its surroundings. Can its embrace help me better understand my sexuality or reconcile the relationship with my father? More broadly, does perceiving architecture as an extension of our skin challenge views of gender roles? I will use 
      <a href="placeholder4.html" class="spring-link">

      </a> 
      (0s and 1s) to probe these questions, expose the downsides of societal binaries, and offer ways to bridge the gaps.
